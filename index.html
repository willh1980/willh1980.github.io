                        <p id=biography>Well to tell you about myself, I'm a 38 year old man who is a Los Angeles native born and raised. I love going to the beach and going to sporting events. I went to Narbonne High school in Harbor City, California. I attented Long Beach State college for a year. I worked in the security industry for 8 years and in the transportation industry for 6 years. I have always had a natural curiosity in regards to computers, so programming is somewhat of a natural career move for me. I really cant't wait to dip my toes in to the infamous Silicon Beach!!!!</p>
